# ControlSimulator
Comparing PID and LQR

## Run the simulation
1. Choose the control method (LQR or PID) at bottom line in `control_animation.py`.
2. Set the `goal_state` in `control_animation.py` ( (x,y) coordinate. Starting point is currently at (0,0))
3. Choose the trajectory (currently only "sin" and "line". Polynomial is under development).
4. Execute the `control_animation.py` file.
