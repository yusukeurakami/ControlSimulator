# ControlSimulator
Comparing PID and LQR

## Run the simulation
1. Choose the control method (LQR or PID) by changing the drone object name.
2. Set the distination ( (x,y) coordinate. Starting point is currently at (0,0))
3. Choose the trajectory (currently only line).
4. Execute the `control_animation.py` file.
